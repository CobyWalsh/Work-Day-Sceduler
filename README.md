## Work Day Scheduler

I created a work day scheduler webpage where the user can easily track thier work day by saving hourly events in the time box through out thier 9am to 5pm work day. The webpage displays the current time in a 24 hour display along with the current date. The time boxes will change color depending on the time of day, the time boxes are set to change from yellow if the time is in the past, red if the time is in the present and green if the time is in the future. When the user clicks the the save button on the right side of the time box the users events will be saved to the local server so the text will not be erased when the webpage is closed or refreshed.
